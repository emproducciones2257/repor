"BLANQUEEN A ARIEL"

This is the final proyect for Codo a Codo 4.0 course, it was dictated by "Buenos Aires Ciudad". The members that made this proyect are Rocío Martín, Emanuel Marquez and Ariel Rodriguez Ponce, we all are from Argentina.

The project is simple, we needed to create an app which has inside a form, then the data the user has put on, go to a mysql database. in addition, we created a list using that data.
